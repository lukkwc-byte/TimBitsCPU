TIMBITS CPU INSTRUCTIONS

Steps to run TimBits CPU:
	- Press the ON/OFF button (main screen, left of the CU blackbox)
	- Optionally, press the ROM ON/OFF button to load instructions from ROM into RAM
	- Enable Simulation. The clock is located on the top left corner of the main CPU circuit

ROM: 
The ROM originally contains the multiplication program required by the assignment, but these can be modified (cf. TimBits_Assembly.pdf for the multiplication program, the TimBits language bit-pattern and ROM instructions).
